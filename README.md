# Final_Project
Files:
  cakes.csv: This is a csv file that holds the data with recipes of cakes
  cookies.csv This is a csv file that holds the data with recipes of cookies
  combine2.py: This is our final project program that will be able to be used be a user to sor
    and graph recipes from a recipe book dataframe.

To run the program from the command line you should type the program name (combine2.py) followed by the csv files 
  you want to import for the dataframe. In this case it would be cookies.csv and cakes.csv. So, in the command line 
  the user should type combine.py cakes.csv cookies.csv. 
  
To use the program, the user will then be prompted to input based on questions asked. User will be asked a variety of questions
  about what they want to sort recipe book by, and what data visualiziation they would like to see. 
 
Source:
   Allrecipes, https://www.allrecipes.com/. This website is what allowed us to obtain 10 different cookie recipes and 10 different cake recipes, as well as their   
   nutrition information. We used the various sections on this website to find what we wanted to use to create the CSV files that would eventually be used in our 
   data analysis.
